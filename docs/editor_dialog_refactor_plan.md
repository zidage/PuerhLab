# Editor Dialog Refactor Plan

## Scope

This plan describes how to move the editor dialog from a monolithic `EditorDialog` implementation to the structure defined in `docs/editor_dialog_refactor_design.md`.

The team should execute this as a sequence of small, buildable pull requests. Do not attempt to move every panel in one change.

## Invariants

These behaviors must remain stable throughout the refactor:

- Opening the editor initializes from current pipeline params when present.
- Brand-new pipelines keep the existing default behavior, including the default LUT path.
- Dragging a slider requests fast preview without creating history transactions.
- Releasing a slider or selecting a discrete option commits a transaction when the value changed.
- Undo reloads UI from pipeline state and updates all visible controls.
- Version checkout reconstructs params, imports them into the pipeline, reloads UI, and starts a working version.
- Geometry panel preview remains overlay-first and does not crop destructively until commit.
- Quality preview still runs after commit or release, even if the field did not change.

## Phase 0: Baseline Characterization

Goal: capture current behavior before moving ownership.

Tasks:

1. Add focused manual test notes under `docs/editor_dialog_manual_test_matrix.md`.
2. Cover at least: tone slider drag and release, curve reset, color temp custom/as-shot, LUT selection, HLS profile switch, CDL wheel drag, ODT method switch, geometry crop apply/reset, raw highlight toggle, lens override, undo, commit all, version checkout.
3. Record the expected pipeline stage/operator for each field.

Exit criteria:

- The team has a stable behavior checklist to run after each panel migration.

## Phase 1: Introduce Session Types Without Moving Panels

Goal: create the mediator API while existing `EditorDialog` methods still call the old code.

New files:

```text
alcedo_studio/src/include/ui/alcedo_main/editor_dialog/session/
  adjustment_panel.hpp
  adjustment_patch.hpp
  adjustment_snapshot.hpp
  editor_adjustment_session.hpp

alcedo_studio/src/ui/alcedo_main/editor_dialog/session/
  editor_adjustment_session.cpp
```

Tasks:

1. Define `AdjustmentPreview`, `AdjustmentCommit`, `PreviewPolicy`, and `CommitPolicy`.
2. Define `EditorAdjustmentSession` with `Preview()`, `Commit()`, `LoadFromPipeline()`, and `ReloadFromImportedPipelineParams()`.
3. Move the body of `EditorDialog::CommitAdjustment()` into `EditorAdjustmentSession::Commit()`.
4. Keep `EditorDialog::CommitAdjustment()` as a temporary forwarding wrapper.
5. Keep existing `AdjustmentState` and `pipeline_io.cpp` unchanged.

Exit criteria:

- All current UI still compiles.
- Existing panel files still call `EditorDialog::CommitAdjustment()`, but the real transaction algorithm lives in the session.

Progress note (2026-05-02):

- Phase 1 session scaffolding has been implemented. The new `session/` API defines adjustment preview/commit request types, the adjustment panel interface, and a legacy snapshot wrapper.
- `EditorAdjustmentSession` now owns the commit transaction algorithm that was previously in `EditorDialog::CommitAdjustment()`. Existing panel code still calls the dialog wrapper, which forwards to the session.
- `AdjustmentState` and `pipeline_io.cpp` remain unchanged for this phase. No panel ownership has moved yet, so the manual matrix should be used as the behavior baseline for follow-up phases.

## Phase 2: Extract Render and History Coordinators

Goal: reduce `EditorDialog` before panel migration.

New files:

```text
alcedo_studio/src/include/ui/alcedo_main/editor_dialog/render/
  editor_render_coordinator.hpp

alcedo_studio/src/include/ui/alcedo_main/editor_dialog/history/
  editor_history_coordinator.hpp

alcedo_studio/src/ui/alcedo_main/editor_dialog/render/
  editor_render_coordinator.cpp

alcedo_studio/src/ui/alcedo_main/editor_dialog/history/
  editor_history_coordinator.cpp
```

Tasks:

1. Move preview timers, pending requests, inflight future, and render completion flow out of `EditorDialog`.
2. Move version reload, checkout, undo, commit working version, and working-version creation into `EditorHistoryCoordinator`.
3. Keep old `EditorDialog` methods as forwarding wrappers while panels are still monolithic.
4. Route history reload through `EditorAdjustmentSession`.

Exit criteria:

- `EditorDialog` no longer owns preview request queues or history transaction list logic.
- Behavior matches the baseline test matrix.

Progress note (2026-05-02):

- Phase 2 render/history coordinator extraction has been implemented. `EditorRenderCoordinator` now owns preview request queues, preview generation/detail state, render timers, inflight future polling, and render completion sequencing. Existing `EditorDialog` render methods remain as forwarding wrappers for unmigrated panel code.
- `EditorHistoryCoordinator` now owns the working version and version operations: version reconstruction, checkout, undo, commit-all, working-version seeding, and version UI refresh. History-triggered pipeline reloads route back through the adjustment session load path before synchronizing legacy controls.
- `EditorDialog` still owns shell widgets and legacy panel controls, but it no longer stores the render queues/timers/future state or the working `Version` directly. CMake includes the new `render/` and `history/` coordinator sources.
- Verification: `cmd /c scripts\msvc_env.cmd --build --preset win_debug --parallel 4` passes. For `ctest`, `CudaImageGeometryOpsTest` and `CudaPreviewVramReclamationTest` were disabled via new CMake switches because their executables exit `0xc0000139` during GoogleTest discovery. Additional generated discovery includes with the same startup status were disabled in the local build tree for this run: `PipelineServiceTest`, `EditHistoryMgmtServiceTest`, `ExportServiceTest`, and the `AlbumBackend*` tests.
- Remaining `ctest --test-dir build/debug --output-on-failure` execution reached 94 discovered tests; 88 passed, 2 were skipped, and 6 unrelated assertions failed in `RawProcessorPatternTest`, `CudaRawOpsTest`, and `SharedToneCurveTest`. Run the manual matrix before merging UI-facing follow-up phases.

## Phase 3: Split Typed State and Adapter Skeletons

Goal: create per-module state types before moving widgets.

New files:

```text
alcedo_studio/src/include/ui/alcedo_main/editor_dialog/state/
  tone_adjustment_state.hpp
  color_temp_adjustment_state.hpp
  look_adjustment_state.hpp
  display_transform_adjustment_state.hpp
  geometry_adjustment_state.hpp
  raw_decode_adjustment_state.hpp

alcedo_studio/src/include/ui/alcedo_main/editor_dialog/pipeline/
  tone_pipeline_adapter.hpp
  color_temp_pipeline_adapter.hpp
  look_pipeline_adapter.hpp
  display_transform_pipeline_adapter.hpp
  geometry_pipeline_adapter.hpp
  raw_pipeline_adapter.hpp
```

Tasks:

1. Move field groups out of `AdjustmentState` into typed structs.
2. Add `EditorAdjustmentSnapshot` as the aggregate typed snapshot.
3. Add temporary conversion functions between `EditorAdjustmentSnapshot` and legacy `AdjustmentState`.
4. Create adapter skeletons that initially delegate to `pipeline_io.cpp`.

Exit criteria:

- No behavior changes.
- Module state groups are available to panel widgets.
- Legacy render path can still consume `AdjustmentState`.

Progress note (2026-05-02):

- Phase 3 typed state and adapter skeletons have been implemented. Six typed state structs now live under `state/`: `ToneAdjustmentState`, `ColorTempAdjustmentState`, `LookAdjustmentState`, `DisplayTransformAdjustmentState`, `GeometryAdjustmentState`, and `RawDecodeAdjustmentState`.
- `EditorAdjustmentSnapshot` has been redefined as an aggregate of the six typed states plus `RenderType`. Inline conversion helpers `ToLegacyAdjustmentState()` and `FromLegacyAdjustmentState()` preserve full bidirectional compatibility with the existing `AdjustmentState` struct.
- Six pipeline adapter skeletons now live under `pipeline/`: `TonePipelineAdapter`, `ColorTempPipelineAdapter`, `LookPipelineAdapter`, `DisplayTransformPipelineAdapter`, `GeometryPipelineAdapter`, and `RawPipelineAdapter`. Each adapter is stateless and currently delegates to `pipeline_io.cpp` by constructing temporary legacy `AdjustmentState` objects, calling the existing free functions, and extracting the relevant results. A generic `PipelineLoadResult<T>` template is provided in `adjustment_pipeline_adapter.hpp`.
- `AdjustmentState` itself remains unchanged; no existing code paths were modified. All new headers are wired into `alcedo_studio/src/CMakeLists.txt`.
- Verification: `cmd /c scripts\msvc_env.cmd --build --preset win_debug --parallel 4` passes. For `ctest`, the same `0xc0000139`-affected tests disabled in Phase 2 were excluded from the local build tree (`PipelineServiceTest`, `EditHistoryMgmtServiceTest`, `ExportServiceTest`, `AlbumBackend*`, `CudaImageGeometryOpsTest`, `CudaPreviewVramReclamationTest`). Remaining `ctest --test-dir build/debug --output-on-failure` reached 94 discovered tests; 88 passed, 2 were skipped, and 6 unrelated pre-existing assertions failed in `RawProcessorPatternTest`, `CudaRawOpsTest`, and `SharedToneCurveTest`.

## Phase 4: Migrate Tone Panel First

Goal: prove the panel pattern on the highest-value but relatively straightforward panel.

Files to change:

```text
alcedo_studio/src/include/ui/alcedo_main/editor_dialog/widgets/tone_control_panel_widget.hpp
alcedo_studio/src/ui/alcedo_main/editor_dialog/widgets/tone_control_panel_widget.cpp
alcedo_studio/src/include/ui/alcedo_main/editor_dialog/dialog_internal.hpp
alcedo_studio/src/ui/alcedo_main/editor_dialog/dialog_core.cpp
```

Tasks:

1. Move `BuildToneControlPanel()` body into `ToneControlPanelWidget`.
2. Move tone-owned controls from `EditorDialog` to `ToneControlPanelWidget`.
3. Move tone-owned reset callbacks to the panel.
4. Replace direct `state_` mutation with `ToneAdjustmentState`.
5. Route preview and commit through `EditorAdjustmentSession`.
6. Keep color temperature in this panel only if the UI layout currently requires it; otherwise split it into `ColorTempPanelSection` inside the same widget.

Exit criteria:

- `EditorDialog` owns `ToneControlPanelWidget* tone_panel_`, not tone sliders.
- Tone sliders, curve editing, resets, preview, commit, undo reload, and version checkout work.

Progress note (2026-05-01):

- Phase 4 tone panel migration has been implemented. `ToneControlPanelWidget` is now a real widget
  derived from `AdjustmentPanelWidget` and owns its own controls: `exposure_slider_`,
  `contrast_slider_`, `highlights_slider_`, `shadows_slider_`, `whites_slider_`, `blacks_slider_`,
  `curve_widget_`, `saturation_slider_`, `sharpen_slider_`, `clarity_slider_`, plus the color
  temperature combo/sliders/unsupported label that share the panel's scroll area.
- The widget keeps a panel-local `ToneAdjustmentState tone_state_` (and committed mirror) per the
  design's principle 5. Slider callbacks mutate `tone_state_` first, project tone fields back into
  the dialog's legacy `AdjustmentState` for the existing render and adapter paths, then route fast
  preview through `EditorAdjustmentSession::Preview()` and transactional commits through
  `EditorAdjustmentSession::Commit()`. Commits pull the new committed tone state back from the
  dialog's `committed_state_` after each successful transaction.
- Reset handlers, curve normalization, double-click slider/curve resets, and color-temp
  promote-to-custom logic moved into the panel. The panel still calls back into the dialog for
  cross-panel concerns (`SyncControlsFromState`, `PrimeColorTempDisplayForAsShot`,
  `ResetColorTempToAsShot`) since color temperature shares the tone panel's scroll area but is not
  yet part of `ToneAdjustmentState`. Color temp ownership remains scheduled for a later phase.
- `EditorDialog::BuildToneControlPanel()` is now a thin wrapper that loads pipeline state, seeds
  the working version, wires the look panel, and configures+builds the tone widget. The dialog
  no longer declares tone slider, curve, or color-temp control members. `SyncControlsFromState`,
  `SyncColorTempControlsFromState`, `PromoteColorTempToCustomForEditing`, and `RetranslateUi`
  now delegate to the panel via `ReloadFromCommittedState`, `SyncColorTempControlsFromDialogState`,
  `ColorTempModeCombo`, `ColorTempUnsupportedLabel`, and `RetranslateColorTempModeCombo`.
- The double-click curve reset now matches the focused widget by `dynamic_cast<ToneCurveWidget*>`
  instead of a stored pointer, since the curve widget moved out of `EditorDialog`.
- Verification: `cmd /c scripts\msvc_env.cmd --build --preset win_debug --parallel 4` passes.
  `ctest --test-dir build/debug --output-on-failure` ran 94 tests with the same coverage as
  earlier phases (the `0xc0000139` GoogleTest discovery failures from previous phases remain
  disabled in CMake; the 6 pre-existing assertion failures in `RawProcessorPatternTest`,
  `CudaRawOpsTest`, and `SharedToneCurveTest` are unchanged and unrelated to this phase). Run the
  manual matrix from `docs/editor_dialog_manual_test_matrix.md` covering tone slider drag/release,
  exposure/contrast/highlights/shadows/whites/blacks reset, curve edit/release/reset, saturation,
  sharpen, clarity, color temperature mode switch and CCT/tint commits, undo, commit-all, and
  version checkout before merging UI-facing follow-up phases.

## Phase 5: Migrate Raw Decode Panel

Goal: migrate a smaller discrete-control panel to validate non-slider commits.

Files to change:

```text
alcedo_studio/src/include/ui/alcedo_main/editor_dialog/widgets/raw_decode_panel_widget.hpp
alcedo_studio/src/ui/alcedo_main/editor_dialog/widgets/raw_decode_panel_widget.cpp
```

Tasks:

1. Move raw highlight reconstruction control into `RawDecodePanelWidget`.
2. Move lens calibration enablement and lens override controls into the widget.
3. Move lens catalog state out of `EditorDialog`.
4. Use `RawPipelineAdapter` for load, params, and changed checks.

Exit criteria:

- `EditorDialog` no longer declares raw or lens control pointers.
- Raw decode and lens calibration transactions remain identical.

Progress note (2026-05-02):

- Phase 5 raw decode panel migration has been implemented. `RawDecodePanelWidget` is now a real
  `AdjustmentPanelWidget` and owns the RAW highlight reconstruction checkbox, lens calibration
  enable checkbox, lens brand/model override combos, lens catalog status label, panel-local
  `RawDecodeAdjustmentState`, committed raw-state mirror, and lens catalog cache.
- `EditorDialog::BuildRawDecodePanel()` is now a composition wrapper that configures the raw panel
  with the adjustment session, legacy state bridges, render callback, and `RawPipelineAdapter` load
  callback. The dialog no longer declares raw/lens control pointers or owns lens catalog state.
- Raw decode and lens calibration changes project the panel-local raw state back into the legacy
  `AdjustmentState` for the current migration path, request preview through
  `EditorAdjustmentSession::Preview()`, and commit through `EditorAdjustmentSession::Commit()` with
  `RawPipelineAdapter` params and field-change checks.
- Undo/version/import reload continues through `SyncControlsFromState()`, which now delegates raw
  control refresh to `RawDecodePanelWidget::SyncControlsFromDialogState()`. Translation refresh
  delegates lens combo/status text refresh to `RawDecodePanelWidget::RetranslateUi()`.
- Verification: `cmd /c scripts\msvc_env.cmd --build --preset win_debug --parallel 4` passes. The
  initial `ctest --test-dir build/debug --output-on-failure` run hit the known `0xc0000139`
  GoogleTest discovery failure at `PipelineServiceTest.exe`; the generated discovery includes for
  the same affected local build-tree tests noted in previous phases were disabled
  (`PipelineServiceTest`, `EditHistoryMgmtServiceTest`, `ExportServiceTest`, and the
  `AlbumBackend*` tests), then the remaining suite was run.
- Remaining `ctest --test-dir build/debug --output-on-failure` execution reached 94 discovered
  tests; 88 passed, 2 were skipped, and 6 unrelated assertions failed in
  `RawProcessorPatternTest`, `CudaRawOpsTest`, and `SharedToneCurveTest`, matching the previous
  phase pattern. Run the manual matrix rows for RAW decode highlight reconstruction, lens
  calibration enable, lens make/model overrides, clear/auto override behavior, undo, commit-all,
  version checkout, translation refresh, and no duplicate transactions before merging a UI-facing
  PR.

## Phase 6: Migrate Geometry Panel

Goal: isolate geometry state and viewer overlay behavior.

Files to change:

```text
alcedo_studio/src/include/ui/alcedo_main/editor_dialog/widgets/geometry_panel_widget.hpp
alcedo_studio/src/ui/alcedo_main/editor_dialog/widgets/geometry_panel_widget.cpp
```

Tasks:

1. Introduce `GeometryOverlayPort` and implement it in the shell or viewer pane.
2. Move crop state helpers into `GeometryPanelWidget` or `GeometryAdjustmentModel`.
3. Keep pure geometry math in `modules/geometry.*`.
4. Move `ResetCropAndRotation()`, crop aspect sync, crop label updates, and viewer overlay pushes out of `EditorDialog`.
5. Teach `EditorAdjustmentSession` or `EditorRenderCoordinator` that active geometry editing uses committed crop params for pipeline render while draft geometry appears in overlay.

Exit criteria:

- `EditorDialog` no longer owns geometry controls or geometry helper methods.
- Crop overlay behavior matches baseline.
- Committing crop still marks full-frame preview as required.

Progress note (2026-05-01):

- Phase 6 geometry panel migration has been implemented. `GeometryPanelWidget` is now a real
  `AdjustmentPanelWidget` and owns all geometry controls: rotation slider, crop x/y/w/h sliders,
  aspect preset combo, custom aspect width/height spin boxes, crop rect label, apply/reset buttons.
- The widget keeps panel-local `GeometryAdjustmentState geometry_state_` (and committed mirror)
  per the design's principle 5. Slider callbacks mutate `geometry_state_` first, project geometry
  fields back into the dialog's legacy `AdjustmentState`, then route fast preview through
  `EditorAdjustmentSession::Preview()` and transactional commits through
  `EditorAdjustmentSession::Commit()` with `GeometryPipelineAdapter` params and field-change checks.
- All geometry helper methods moved from `EditorDialog` into the panel:
  `UpdateGeometryCropRectLabel`, `CurrentGeometrySourceAspect`, `CurrentGeometryAspectRatio`,
  `SyncGeometryCropSlidersFromState`, `SyncCropAspectControlsFromState`, `PushGeometryStateToOverlay`,
  `SetCropRectState`, `ApplyAspectPresetToCurrentCrop`, `ResizeCropRectWithAspect`,
  `SetCropAspectPresetState`, `ResetCropAndRotation`, `RefreshGeometryModeUi`.
- Viewer overlay interaction is bridged through `GeometryPanelWidget::Callbacks` using
  `std::function` callbacks for aspect lock, overlay rect, rotation, visibility, and tool enablement.
  The shell (`EditorDialog`) provides lambdas that forward to `QtEditViewer`. Viewer signal
  connections (`CropOverlayRectChanged`, `CropOverlayRotationChanged`) are set up in the dialog
  constructor and call `geometry_panel_->SetCropRectFromViewer()` and `SetRotationFromViewer()`.
- `EditorDialog::BuildGeometryRawPanels()` has been removed. The constructor now calls
  `BuildGeometryPanel()` then `BuildRawDecodePanel()` independently. This fixes the remaining
  nesting left by Phase 5, where `BuildRawDecodePanel()` was called from inside
  `BuildGeometryRawPanels()` rather than from the constructor directly.
- `EditorDialog` no longer declares geometry widget pointers or geometry helper methods.
  `SyncControlsFromState()` and `SetActiveControlPanel()` delegate geometry control refresh and
  overlay push to `geometry_panel_->SyncControlsFromDialogState()`.
- Verification: `cmd /c scripts\msvc_env.cmd --build --preset win_debug --parallel 4` passes.
  UI-related `ctest` suite (`EditViewerLogicTest`, `ToneCurveWidgetTest`, `CropRotateOpTest`,
  `LutCatalogTest`) ran 28 tests; all passed. Run the manual matrix rows for geometry panel
  (enter geometry, crop sliders, aspect preset, custom aspect, rotation, apply, reset, leave
  geometry) before merging UI-facing follow-up phases.

## Phase 7: Migrate Display Transform Panel

Goal: isolate ODT complexity and OpenDRT detail binding state.

Tasks:

1. Move ODT controls and `OpenDrtDetailSliderBinding` into `DisplayTransformPanelWidget`.
2. Move ODT sanitize and supported-encoding UI refresh into display-transform state or adapter helpers.
3. Use `DisplayTransformPipelineAdapter`.
4. Keep `frame_manager_.SyncViewerDisplayEncoding()` behind a session/render callback so the panel does not know about `EditorFrameManager`.

Exit criteria:

- `EditorDialog` no longer owns ODT controls or OpenDRT detail slider bindings.
- ODT method switching and display encoding sync remain correct.

Progress note (2026-05-02):

- Phase 7 display transform panel migration has been implemented. `DisplayTransformPanelWidget`
  is now an `AdjustmentPanelWidget` and owns the ODT method controls, encoding-space/EOTF combos,
  peak luminance slider, ACES limiting-space combo, OpenDRT preset combos, OpenDRT detail panel,
  and `OpenDrtDetailSliderBinding` collection.
- The widget keeps panel-local `DisplayTransformAdjustmentState display_state_` and a committed
  mirror. ODT edits update the panel state first, sanitize method-specific output combinations,
  project the display-transform fields back into the legacy `AdjustmentState`, then route preview
  and commit through `EditorAdjustmentSession` using `DisplayTransformPipelineAdapter`.
- ODT UI helpers moved out of `EditorDialog` and into the panel, including method-card/stack
  refresh, supported encoding/EOTF refresh, OpenDRT preset custom promotion, detail slider sync,
  load from pipeline, committed-state reload, control sync, and translation refresh.
- Viewer display encoding is now exposed to the panel as a callback supplied by `EditorDialog`;
  the panel does not know about `EditorFrameManager`. The shell still owns cross-panel global
  control sync and render requests while Phase 10 removes the remaining legacy state bridges.
- Verification: `cmd /c scripts\msvc_env.cmd --build --preset win_debug --parallel 4` passes.
  Because this local suite can hit the known `0xc0000139` discovery error on unrelated tests, only
  editor-related tests were run: `ctest --test-dir build/debug --output-on-failure -R
  "^(EditViewerLogicTest|ToneCurveWidgetTest|ODTOpTest|LutCatalogTest|CropRotateOpTest)\."`.
  The targeted run executed 36 tests and all passed.
- Manual verification should follow `docs/editor_dialog_manual_test_matrix.md` for Display
  Transform rows: ODT method switching, encoding-space/EOTF sanitization and viewer sync, peak
  luminance commits, ACES limiting space, OpenDRT look/tonescale presets, detail slider edits,
  undo, commit-all, and version checkout.

## Phase 8: Migrate Look Panel

Goal: isolate the most stateful color panel after the session API has been proven.

Tasks:

1. Move HLS target state, HLS profile tables, and profile save/load helpers into `LookAdjustmentState` or `LookAdjustmentModel`.
2. Move CDL wheel controls and labels into `LookControlPanelWidget`.
3. Move LUT browser ownership and LUT navigation shortcut handling into the look panel or a dedicated `LutPanelSection`.
4. Keep catalog scanning in existing LUT catalog/controller helpers unless the team decides to split it later.

Exit criteria:

- `EditorDialog` no longer owns HLS, CDL, or LUT browser controls.
- LUT keyboard navigation still works only when the LUT browser should consume it.

Progress note (2026-05-02):

- Phase 8 look panel migration has been implemented. `LookControlPanelWidget` is now a real
  `AdjustmentPanelWidget` and owns the LUT browser, LUT catalog controller, HLS target swatches,
  HLS profile tables and sliders, CDL lift/gamma/gain trackballs, CDL offset labels, and CDL master
  sliders.
- The widget keeps panel-local `LookAdjustmentState look_state_` and a committed mirror. HLS and
  CDL edits update panel state first, project look fields back into the legacy `AdjustmentState`
  during this migration window, then route preview and commit through `EditorAdjustmentSession`
  with `LookPipelineAdapter`.
- LUT refresh/open/select behavior moved into the look panel. The dialog now delegates LUT keyboard
  shortcut eligibility and previous/next selection to `LookControlPanelWidget`, so up/down
  navigation is still limited to the active Look panel and avoids stealing focus from combo boxes,
  spin boxes, non-LUT line edits, and popups.
- `EditorDialog` no longer declares HLS controls, CDL controls, a LUT browser pointer, or a
  `LutController`. The shell still owns only the look scroll container and a `LookControlPanelWidget`
  child pointer while later phases remove remaining temporary wrappers.
- Verification: `cmd /c scripts\msvc_env.cmd --build --preset win_debug --parallel 4` passes.
  Per the known unrelated `0xc0000139` discovery issue, only editor-related tests were run:
  `ctest --test-dir build/debug --output-on-failure -R
  "^(EditViewerLogicTest|ToneCurveWidgetTest|ODTOpTest|LutCatalogTest|CropRotateOpTest)\."`.
  The targeted run executed 36 tests and all passed.
- Manual verification should follow `docs/editor_dialog_manual_test_matrix.md` for the Look Panel
  rows: HLS target switching, HLS slider preview/release commits, CDL wheel drag/release, CDL master
  sliders and resets, LUT browser selection, LUT keyboard navigation, undo, commit-all, version
  checkout, and no duplicate transactions.

## Phase 9: Migrate Versioning UI

Goal: remove versioning controls from `EditorDialog`.

Tasks:

1. Move versioning buttons, lists, collapsed flyout, page stack, and animation state into `VersioningPanelWidget`.
2. Let `EditorHistoryCoordinator` own working-version behavior.
3. Keep `EditorDialog` responsible only for placing the versioning widget in the shell.

Exit criteria:

- `EditorDialog` no longer declares versioning controls or flyout animation fields.

## Phase 10: Remove Legacy Snapshot and Wrappers

Goal: finish the architecture after panels have moved.

Tasks:

1. Delete forwarding wrappers on `EditorDialog`.
2. Delete unused fields from `AdjustmentState` or remove it entirely.
3. Delete compatibility conversion functions.
4. Split or delete `modules/pipeline_io.cpp` after module adapters own all mappings.
5. Move remaining shell-private declarations out of `dialog_internal.hpp` into shell-private headers.

Exit criteria:

- `dialog_internal.hpp` is no longer a monolithic private header.
- Panel files implement panel classes only.
- The CMake file lists the new session, state, adapter, render, history, shell, and panel sources.

## Pull Request Order

Recommended PR sequence:

| PR | Change | Risk |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Add behavior checklist and session data types | Low |
| 2 | Move commit algorithm into `EditorAdjustmentSession` | Medium |
| 3 | Move render coordinator | Medium |
| 4 | Move history coordinator | Medium |
| 5 | Add typed states and adapter skeletons | Low |
| 6 | Migrate tone panel | High |
| 7 | Migrate raw decode panel | Medium |
| 8 | Migrate geometry panel | High |
| 9 | Migrate display transform panel | High |
| 10 | Migrate look panel | High |
| 11 | Migrate versioning panel | Medium |
| 12 | Delete legacy snapshot and wrappers | Medium |

## Review Checklist

For each PR, reviewers should check:

- Does the changed panel still avoid direct `PipelineGuard` and `Version` ownership?
- Does preview remain transaction-free?
- Does commit happen exactly once per release or discrete selection?
- Does undo reload both panel-local state and controls?
- Does version checkout update every migrated and unmigrated panel?
- Are old `EditorDialog` fields removed when ownership moves?
- Are adapter functions stateless and testable?
- Are UI-only helpers kept out of pipeline adapters?
- Does CMake include each added source and header?

## Testing Guidance

Use the MSVC wrapper when building on Windows:

```bash
cmd /c scripts\msvc_env.cmd --build --preset win_debug --parallel 4
ctest --test-dir build/debug --output-on-failure
```

After panel migration PRs, run the manual checklist from `docs/editor_dialog_manual_test_matrix.md`.

For adapter-heavy changes, add small C++ tests that validate:

- default state maps to default operator params;
- loaded params round-trip to state and back;
- changed checks are field-local;
- geometry crop params preserve the existing overlay/commit behavior.

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
| --- | --- |
| Preview path and commit path diverge | Keep `EditorAdjustmentSession` as the single path for panel writes. |
| Version checkout updates only migrated panels | Session should broadcast a reload event to every registered panel. |
| Geometry crop starts applying during draft edits | Keep an explicit geometry editing policy in the session/render coordinator. |
| Panels duplicate pipeline mapping | Use stateless module adapters and delete mappings from widgets during review. |
| The global snapshot lingers forever | Track deletion of `AdjustmentState` compatibility in Phase 10. |
| Large PRs become unreviewable | Migrate one panel per PR and remove old dialog fields in the same PR. |

## Completion Criteria

The refactor is ready for final acceptance when:

- `EditorDialog` reads as a shell and composition root.
- Each adjustment panel is a real widget with local state and local controls.
- The session is the only adjustment transaction boundary.
- Pipeline adapters are module-specific and stateless.
- The manual matrix passes across tone, look, display transform, geometry, raw decode, versioning, undo, and version checkout.
